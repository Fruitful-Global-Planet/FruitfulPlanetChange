Just now
I understand you have many apps and this database pause is affecting your workflow. Let me search for information about database unpausing in Replit's documentation:


Searched Replit documentation for "How to unpause or unfreeze a PostgreSQL database that has been paused by Replit infrastructure"
According to Replit's documentation, PostgreSQL databases automatically enter an inactive state after 5 minutes of inactivity, but they instantly reactivate when they receive a query. This is a normal serverless behavior designed for cost optimization.

Looking at your logs, I can see your database is actually working perfectly:

Your API calls are successfully returning data: {"totalElements":3794,"coreBrands":286...}
All database queries are responding normally
Your authentic brand data is accessible
The database isn't truly "frozen" - it's in serverless mode and responds to queries immediately. Your Seedwave Portal is fully functional with all 3,794 brands accessible.

If you're experiencing different behavior with your other 150+ apps, this might be a broader account-level issue. For account-wide database management, you'll need to contact Replit support directly as this is beyond what can be resolved within the application code.

Your current Seedwave Portal is operating normally with full database access.
