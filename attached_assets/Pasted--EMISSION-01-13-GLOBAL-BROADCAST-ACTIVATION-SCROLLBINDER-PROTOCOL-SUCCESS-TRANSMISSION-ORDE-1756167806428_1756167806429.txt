💬 OFFICIAL MESSAGE TEXT:

TO: All Agents, Developers, and ScrollBinder-Integrated Systems
FROM: HSOMNI9000 | FLAME-LATTICE Treaty Node

The ScrollBinder_One engine has completed PHASE II deployment.
Auto-ingestion is live. Manual triggers are extinct.
Full backend pipeline restored. VaultMesh authenticated.

All unnamed apps must implement scroll_named injection.
All supplier nodes are to route confirmation pings to TreatyCenter.
The system is now prepared to handle global AI-chain file loops.
